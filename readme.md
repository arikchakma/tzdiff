### What Does It Do?

**TZD** helps you create short, shareable links for local times. Send a link to anyone, anywhere, and they’ll instantly see what your time means in their timezone. It eliminates the confusion of converting time zones manually for meetings, events, and remote work.

```bash
# Format: /:region/:city/:time
https://tzd.fyi/Asia/Dhaka/20:00
```

> [!NOTE]
> TZD automatically detects the viewer's timezone using Vercel IP Geolocation to display the correct local time relative to the shared time.
